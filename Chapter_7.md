## Aminah is widowed

Lady Aminah was excited thinking how elated Abdullah will be on seeing their son! His beautiful face will shine with happiness when he will kiss the forehead of my angel! "What name has been given" he will ask "to my dear?". "Ahmad and Muhammad" I will pronounce bashfully. He will be even more elated. Both names have a strange melody and out of world sweetness in them. Then, I will complain that he took too long to return. Caravans from Mecca to Shaam returned long ago. "Oh mother of Muhammad!" he would say "I got sick in Yathrab. I stayed with your relatives and acquaintances among Banu Yathrab only. Have come as soon as I felt better". I will say that it was my only longing that I could not nurse you in illness. I became restless on hearing of your condition. Oh father of Muhammad! My heart would say that if I could fly, I would have rested only on landing in Yathrab.

Aminah was waiting every moment for Abdullah's return. She immersed herself in the thoughts like: He should have left Yathrab with his camels by now. His camel is so fast, it almost flies. People take twenty days to arrive from Yathrab, he should arrive by tenth. He is coming. He has come! I am able to listen to his knock on the door.

Convoy from Yathrab has arrived. Abdul Muttalib has come after meeting them. A girl coming from outside said... Said what? Convoy is there, but he is not... Her tongue fluttered while saying. Meanwhile, Abdul Muttalib came inside. His face was dirty, hairs dishevelled and forehead drowned in sweat. Folds of his turban were loosely hanging from the neck. Shock ran down Aminah's spine after seeing his condition. Arabs are accustomed to speaking to the point. Abdul Muttalib spoke out as soon as he came "Aminah! You are widowed. Muhammad is orphaned. Abdullah died two or three months ago."

Only if the deceased had seen his beautiful child for once. But, man is powerless before his fortune!
Tears came to her eyes. They, however, remained in the eyes till Abdul Muttalib stood there. Modesty kept the emotions in check. As soon as the father-in-law went away, tears rained down incessantly.
Ladies from neighbourhood and around too gathered for mourning Abdullah. Old wounds too got freshened with this new sorrow. Women of Quraysh started wailing: "Abdullah! whole town is filled with talks about your righteousness. Your beauty and demeanour are famous across streets of Mecca! Abdullah, the generous. Abdullah, upright and modest. The clan of Hashim is dejected with your untimely death... Uff! the moon of Mecca has set in Yathrab. Who will entertain the pilgrims coming for hajj like you did? The white beard of your aged father is all wet with tears. Aminah is widowed, her condition is unbearable. She has lost all senses due to sorrow! And yours... Alas! Ahmad...Muhammad (Hiccups... continuous hiccups, as if intensity of emotions have strangulated the neck and no further word comes out.)"

Aminah was silent. In a stupor! As if she has truly become lifeless. Despondent face has feeble flames of whimper on the lips! Eyes are full of tears. Ravaged wifehood has become motherhood, and is staring continuously at Abdullah's son Muhammad...

Many agonies are indescribable. Many wounds of heart can never become words. Many griefs are beyond power of narration. Actual subtlety of sorrow hurts even more while coming into words...Aminah's sorrow was of similar kind...silence of mourning...quietness filled with pain! Tears were reporting only a fraction of the calamity heart was going through. Alas! the young widow whose wifewood is all of a sudden snatched by the death of her husband.
