## Abdullah: the virtuous
---
Abdul Muttalib had as many as ten sons. But Abdullah, for whose sacrifice the father had wielded knife, was the most beautiful and handsome among them. Abu Lahab too had a red face, but like a smoldering amber. One which would invoke nausea and disgust rather than attraction. Abdullah's face had a striking captivation and attraction. His forehead had a wondrous shine, like of which was not seen on any youth from the Quraysh -- his forehead was truly a dawn of light, out of which many a mornings would beam out smiling.

One afternoon, a shepherd from Quraysh came home running and reported to his family: "I observed something weird today. I've come to the town from jungle to apprise you of that. Just a little while ago, I was tending to my goats when Abdul Muttalib's son Abdullah passed nearby. Bright sunlight was falling. Horizon too was all clear. Rays from sun were setting bodies alight. That is when I saw that a piece of cloud was shadowing over Abdullah. Not only that, the cloud was following him around as he moved."

People smirked, thinking that the shepherd has come out of a dream or his eyes have glared in sunlight, causing his vision to blunder.
All ignored the witness of the poor boy as a joke. Irritated, the shepherd retorted "You all consider me a liar, my eyes have not erred. If you don't trust me, I can hold the curtain of Ka'aba and repeat my words or I can take oath while touching the holy feet of Laat and Hubal. I agree that the incident is incredible, but how could I not trust my own vision?"

On hearing this, an old Arab, as he stressed a bow with his elbow, spoke: "Our deities Laat and Uzza burn in the scorching sun and no piece of cloud is inspired to hold its shadow over them, even though these idols are responsible for fulfilling our needs. It is only due to them that the dates in Mecca grow and the vegetation in Taif flourishes. They help us in our wars too. Is this son of Abdul Muttalib holier and more elevated than Laat and Hubal? We are an experienced lot, not to be fooled by a naive kid." Everyone started laughing. The shepherd went back to the jungle irked.

Environment at Mecca was full of obscenity and wrongdoings, but Abdullah had a natural inclination towards piety and virtuousness right from the beginning. He would immediately close his eyes on hearing the bustle of naked women circuiting the holy Ka'bah. He was completely disillusioned with the perversions of the youths of Quraysh. Fellow young men would ridicule him and say "Abdullah should sit at home putting bangles in his hands and scarf on his head. This bashful son of Abdul Muttalib is completely devoid of desires of a young man. To spend your prime like priests and saints is a grave mistake and foolishness. These are the days meant to be enjoyed and celebrated...Ah! the poor life of Abdullah! dry, tasteless and free of pleasures. Nights are even more boring than days, as if his garden has not bloomed yet."

One day, Abdulah was passing through a lane of Mecca. The air was filled with dirt and the ground was embossed with the feet of camels, as if some camels had just passed from there. His eyes were fixed to these markings when the entrance to one of the houses opened all of a sudden. Abdullah saw a young girl from Mar Al Khasha'mah standing behind the opened door. With youth, beauty, elegance and perfect physique, the girl was an expression of attraction and charm from head to toe. She stopped Abdullah with a gesture and delivered the message of her carnal desires. This was an initiation from beauty and prime. Glamour was taking step forward, all by itself. Abdullah too had a youthful heart filled with the warmth of feelings! Id tried to arouse him, saying: "Such opportunities don't show up often. Hordes of young Quraysh are desirous of this beauty. Everybody seems to hold his heart out for her. And she is stepping towards you by her own! Don't throw this golden opportunity away. Offers from beauty and prime are not meant to be rejected..." But, Abdullah's conscience clicked off. It got hold of his veins of shyness and sense. He did not accept even a smile from the virgin.

The beauty from Kasha'mah had confidence that Abdullah will come forward to cheerfully welcome her steps. Now that she tasted failure contrary to the expectations, her winsomeness got irritated. Intensity of anger blended redness into the white cheeks. However, the girl was very mindful! With great patience and restrain she was able to hide her annoyance and tried using red camels as bait in addition to her beauty and prime. But, Abdullah moved on while answering her with the following verses:

"It is better to die than adopting a haraam act. I definitely like halaal, but that requires public declaration... You allure and seduce, but guarding chastity prescribed by religion is a must for any righteous man."

She was left looking at the way. Only the marking of his feet remained there, Abdullah had left the place after rejecting her calls of lust.

House of Abdul Munaf has got meat from hunting. Pot is boiling over a stove. An old woman is stirring water with a ladle. People in the house are sitting on ground and waiting for food. Huge earthen bowls are lying before them. "What reply did you send to Abdul Muttalib?" asked a middle aged Arab. "I'm all for it. Just waiting a few days for my uncle to return from Mecca, I need to take his counsel. Advice of elderly is always beneficial." The old man replied: "It's unwise to unnecessarily delay this virtuous deed, I suggest! There is no dearth of girls in Mecca for Abdul Muttalib's son Abdullah. There are people wishing to somehow they get their daughters betrothed to him. You can't get a better match in the whole of Arabia. His family is the most respected of all Quraysh. His father Abdul Muttalib is the leader of Quraysh. Do you consider it any small feat that the well of Zamzam, which was filled off by Umaru bin Hars Jarhami and nobody even remembered its name, was dug out by Abdul Muttalib along with his son Haris? Oh Ibn-e-Umm! Hasten to let the stars of Amnah's destiny shine."

The alliance was agreed upon. Acceptance of the proposal was conveyed to the house of Abdul Muttalib. Both parties expressed happiness, Abdullah was after all the favourite, 'sacrificed' son of his father. Quraysh would swear by his virtues and righteousness. As for Amnah's family, she was the light of their lives, an idol of dignity and modesty! a mould for piety! Arab women would freely engage in fetes and fairs, partake in drinking parties.
But, Amnah was born different and unique, she was shy even while talking to her relatives. Her scarf would never slip from head. Arab woman would say that she is truly a doll -- quite, serious and sincere! Bereft of charms of girls. Her family not only used to loves her, but respect her as well.

Abdul Muttalib, along with other leaders from Quraysh, reached the house of Abdullah's in-laws. Girl's family welcomed the delegation. They were dressed in long shirts, with ropes wound around their waists. Their hands carried swords. Few had Yemeni sheets on shoulders and some had  flowery designs embroidered on collars using exquisite Shaami silk. Singing and music were going on in the house of the bride. Young girls of Quraysh were singing and beating hand drums. Their songs described greatness of Ka'bah, pride of Quraysh's lineage, praise for Abu Qabees and loyalty of camels. Some lyrics celebrated the fighting spirit of the Quraysh. That  their skills with swords shine once drenched in blood and opposing them means taking sky and earth as enemies. The songs were not very coherent, but the choir of the girls was passionate and melodious. The Arabs were swaying while listening to them. The mild scales had doubled their joy... song procreates happiness and delight sprouts out of its notes.

The wedding was performed in the traditional Arab manner. With utter simplicity it was declared that Abdullah, son of Abdul Muttalib, and Amnah, daughter of Wahab, have come into nikah of each other. People congratulated Abdul Muttalib. The chief of Quraysh raised his eyes to the heaven in gratitude. The stars of destiny conjoined and the two lives became partners of each other.

Amnah bade farewell to her parent's house and reached her new home. Women in the family received the esteemed bride, rather rolled out the red carpet in her welcome. Everybody was saying that they have never seen such a destined couple. Abdullah is like a sun, while Amnah is a moon. Both righteous and bashful, idols of modesty and nobility! Each one is answer to the other, hide one and show the other!

Abdul Muttalib threw feast to the close ones, relatives and friends. Huge pots were filled with gravy. Pieces of breads were soaked in them. This was the favourite food of Arabs: thareed. Thareed was served in over-sized dishes and several of the invitees sat around each one of it. Laughter and joking too continued while eating.

"...This meat is from the camel that carried Loban, Bakhoor and perfumes from Yemen." "Yes! Yes! that is why it smells so good" (Laughter). "Oh Abu Qariyah! have a look at this bone, it is sharper than a sword. Ancestors of this camel must have been owned by great fencers." (young men started laughing). "Talk gently Waleed! this is Abdul Muttalib's house, not the bar of Radha'ah, son of Qumiyah. Respect and sincerity are the hallmarks of Hashmi family."

Abdul Muttalib circled Kaba'h, taking Abdullah and other sons along! As a gesture of thanksgiving. Love, faith and heartfelt passion too were a part of this exercise. Beautiful pigeons were dancing on the boundaries of Ka'bah. Supposedly, they too were accompanying those circuiting it and saying that consider us as allies in this moment of happiness.
