## Holy arrival: the blessed morning

Life is a dream. And many dreams turn into reality. However, not everybody is able to see such true dreams. Many consider dreams as storytelling of imaginations and sculpting by suspicions.
But, it is a matter of one's open-mindedness and purity of heart and vision. Some dreams are way above the crafts of doubts and suspicions. Interface between the present and future is laid out in such a manner that images of events to come start forming on the mirror of perception. Such dreams are truer and more useful, even holier, than conscious thoughts of others.

There are many in this world who appear awake, but have their hearts always asleep. They find no clue of guidance in all that breaths, neither in the expanses of the universe. Even from the watchtowers of events past and present, they fail to achieve a glance over projections from future. All their lives are passed in utter ignorance. However, some selected souls are blessed with consciousness even in the land of dreams. And future bares itself before them all by itself.

Amnah started having dreams. Extremely strange, but *beautiful* dreams! Sometimes, she would see her worldly body shining like a glass and warm rays emerging from its every spot. Sometimes, she heard houris of paradise, angels of heavens and pure spirits congratulating her. At times she even felt that she has been elevated along with her pure and luminous body, highest of mountains would appear low with her feet touching the stars whilst tunes of blessings and congratulations filled the ambience.

As per tradition, women of the tribe would come to inquire of Amnah's health. It would appear to them that a canopy of light is stretched between the door of Ka'bah and Abdullah's house, which is held by hands whiter and brighter than flame of camphor. Discussions started taking place in the houses that Amnah has favours from the luminous goddesses of the heaven. Amnah, the daughter of Wahab, daughter-in-law of Abdul Muttalib, life partner of Abdullah and mother of the child to come, has herself become Venus or Mercury.

"Eh lo! Stars are descending towards earth. What's going on today?" enquired Abdullah's aunt. "I too am seeing the same. The level of illumination this passing night has, not even brightness of day can match it" an old woman answered. "Umm-e-Ma'bad! And these cold morning currents, it seems the whole environment is swinging with passion at the teasing of the sweet breeze. I've experienced mornings in the gardens and greenery of Taif. However, this one is altogether different. And these wafts of sweet smell, it feels as is somebody has gathered  all perfumes from Yemen and sprinkled them here." "Wish there was no end to this and we were to witness it forever" a third woman said while adjusting her scarf.

Those who woke up early in the houses of Quraysh were getting tired of picking and holding their idols. However, the idols would no way stand up straight today. Their foreheads were automatically falling into prostration. "What has happened to my god today? He is falling and lying down! May be he is feeling sleepy. But, statues don't sleep, may be he his angry with me. Let me prostrate once more with the passion of faith." the old Quraysh bent down after supporting the idol by a wall. When he raised his head, found the head of the statue again lying on ground. Meanwhile, a lady came running. She spoke out while holding the hand of the old man: "Come and see, the lord of Fareestah, provider of Zaheer, deity of Qais and my own god -- all are lying down with their foreheads on dirt." The old man released his hand forcefully and answered: "I'm myself facing the same. Don't you see my god, he too has his head on ground! Go and take care of your gods, I'll handle mine."

At the house of Abdul Muttalib, Amnah was in a state of pleasant slumber. It was in this condition that her ears heard:
"This is Hajrah (Hagar), the mother of Isma'eel (Ishmael) -- the sacrificed for God." Then the voice paused for a moment. It reappeared in an even sweeter tone:
"Congratulations mother of Ahmad(PBUH)! Ibrahim (Abraham) has sent prayers for you." Then after another brief pause a voice echoed: "Amnah! This is Maryam (Mary), mother of 'Isa (Jesus) -- the soul from Allah. The virgin Maryam, the respected mother of preacher of the revered city!" Then another voice: "Mother of Muhammad (PBUH)! Receive glad tidings of Messiah!"

Day and night were quite indistinguishable at the moment. Destinies of both were to shine together. White dawn was spreading out. Delicate folds of buds were opening up. Smile was scattered through the lips of Tulip and other flowers. Pearls of dew were sliding on the fragile leaves of sweet Violet and Shaqeeq. Musical Box-tree stretched on getting a whiff of flowery smell. Chirpings of songbirds drenched the whole environment in melody. Truly, paradise had descended to earth today. Valley of Minah, pebbles in Marwah, hills of Qabees and ground of Arfat were all pattering in the drizzle of light.

Stars were twinkling, buds cracking and flower were just spreading their fragrance when the ladies shouted with happiness:
"Somebody should congratulate Abdul Muttalib!"

Abdul Muttalib came quickly after hearing of this good news. His steps were all over the place due to excitement. Happiness was glittering in the wrinkles of his cheeks. Amnah drove a chador over her face in shyness. Abdul Muttalib saw his Grandson and kissed His forehead. His eyes were lit as if they are filled with lightening.

"Oh Leader of Quraysh! You must not have seen such a bright face till now." women said in one voice. "Without a doubt! Not only me, I think nobody on this earth has witnessed such grandeur. Moon, sun, constellations, rainbows, flowers and buds! I am bewildered that none is fit as simile for the face of this newborn. All fade in comparison with His beauty and handsomeness! And I am not saying all this out of sheer love. It is truth coming out spontaneously on my tongue."

The ladies started whispering among themselves on hearing Abdul Muttalib. Just as somebody who wishes to speak out but is too afraid too express his thoughts does.

"What is this whispering all about? Okay! You want to sing. Should I leave? Must be feeling shy in playing drum in front of an oldman like me."
Women answered Abdul Muttalib: "Oh father of Abdullah! The vibes we witnessed last night, people would think that we have gone crazy or have been hypnotized if we were to describe those. They would believe that our minds have faltered. The state of the night could not be described with words. It could only have been seen. Even if somebody tries to describe, how would those feelings fit into speech?" Abdul Muttalib smiled and intended to go.

"Should we call this new hashimite Ibne Abdullah?" asked one of the ladies. "Okay! indication is towards the name. I name this piece of Abdullah's heart and apple of Amnah's eye as Ahmad and Muhammad (praiseworthy) (PBUH) too. My beloved will be praised the world over." (Suddenly, a song echoed softly in the environment...Not just on earth, heavens too will be filled with the songs of his praise and love.) Amnah gently smiled on hearing the answer of Abdul Muttalib, as if it was her heartfelt thoughts that came out of Abdul Muttalib's mouth.
