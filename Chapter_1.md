## Morning of sacrifice
---
Smoke seemed to emerge from the dwindling
lamps of stars -- it was pre-dawn!
Haze and light had blended into one.
Sun was about to peep from the window of East;
moon and stars, the travellers of night,
had packed their belongings and were just about
to leave;
the chessboard of night was ready to be upturned,
its pieces were all shaking by themselves.

Soft and cold morning breeze is too alluring for body.
Very few like to wake out of their sweet dreams.
Cresses on the bed get hold of the one over them and say:
"Don't betray at once.
The day is yet to start.
Let the sunlight spread properly,
only then think of leaving.
Turn sides and stretch with full pleasure.
Don't get up immediately after rubbing your dream-filled eyes with palms.
Allow the buds crack open first,
what's there to hurry?
Dew is yet to fully ablute the faces of half open flowers.
Pleasure of sleep is felt only after waking up.
Enjoy the feeling! Do not leave it in between.
Those who get up immediately after waking are
bereft of the full pleasure of dreaming."
It was pre-dawn at Mecca.
People were asleep, engulfed in the cold morning currents.
Silence of night was not completely over yet. 
Sound of bells jingling in the necks of camels
was coming from some of the roads -- moderate but chaotic sound,
as if some novice priest was ringing bells in a temple.
Silence of slumber was all over the houses in Mecca.
However, a respected figure was sitting near the gate
of Banu Hashim's enormous house.
He was resting on a black quilt with his back laid to the wall behind.
Wrinkles would periodically emerge, in a state of deep thought, on his forehead,
but would soon straighten out.
His eyelids were heavy with anxiety.
Sometimes a gleam would appear in them,
at others they would appear darkened --
each thought was branching out into many possibilities.
All of a sudden, he rose to his feet and started roaming swiftly
in the courtyard.

Sunlight was all over the place.
Bright sunrays had written golden verses
on the hilltops of Mt. Abu Qabees.
Birds were chirping, goats bleating and camels grunting,
all unbeknownst to the man immersed in deep thought.
Intensity of thinking and reflection had made him
oblivious of the morning hustle.
People in the house were looking at him with amazed and searching gazes:
Have Banu Umaiyya and Banu Hashim picked a fight?
Will the swords of their descendents be unleashed again!
The camels laden with merchandise on their way from Shaam
-- have they been looted?
Hajj season is approaching fast,
may be some planning for its arrangements is occupying his mind!
But, Abdul Muttalib has never appeared such tense,
he did not even go to the Darul Nadwah.
Leaders of Quraysh must be waiting for him.
Everybody was guessing as per his own thoughts,
but no one could muster courage to ask the man directly.

Abdul Muttalib swept the sweat dripping from his forehead,
clenched his fists closed and opened them -- several times,
and finally spoke as he raised his long, flowing shirt:
"Where is Abdullah? Call him. Today, I will fulfill my vow by sacrificing him under the shadow of Ka'bah."

Stunned and amazed, people in the house were staring at each other.
Colors of their faces had suddenly faded after listening to the decision of Abdul Muttalib -- as if it was water, not blood, that flowed through their veins.
The courtyard of the house had, close to the stack of panniers,
a huge shelf carved into the wall.
It contained earthenwares, ropes, empty pouches of sattu, an iron helmet, pieces of a broken Armour and a few steel weapons.
Abdul Muttalib picked a knife from the shelf and started inspecting its edge.
The blade was sharp.
Still, out of caution, Abdul Muttalib preferred rubbing it against the iron of the Armour.

The news spread all around like a lightening strike, within no time.
The vow that Abdul Muttalib had made,
that if Allah gives him ten sons,
I would sacrifice one amongst them to seek his closeness;
he is preparing to fulfill that vow today.
Edge of the knife is being sharpened to its extreme.
Men have been sent to bring Abdullah.
People in the Hashmi's house are both true to their words and iron-willed,
and then Abdul Muttalib is the leader of Quraysh,
to have him abandon his pledge is near to impossible.

Within a short while, Abullah, along with Harith, Abu Talib and his other brethren, had joined the presence of his father.
Soon, his mother's family also reached there upon hearing of the imminent sacrifice of their grandson.
Abdullah was quietly standing towards one side.
Everybody's eyes were fixated to him...
eyes full of pity, almost begging to say:
"Hope! someone could snatch the knife out of Abdul Muttalib's hand."

Observing this scene of sympathy, Abdul Muttalib placed one of his feet on the camel's pannier and said:
"You all have gathered to make a coward out of me!
Strange is this display of compassion that
comes in the way of an upright man trying to be fulfill his oath!
Everybody is aware of my vow.
Last night, I had a draw of lots.
I cast lots with full care and responsibility.
Abdullah's name came out.
Today, I will sacrifice him to have my promise fulfilled.
Those who lack will and courage may draw 'daaman' of their shirts over eyes.
Those who find themselves too weak to bear the scream of the one being slaughtered, should stuff their ears with cotton.
People care for my son, but not for my rectitude and honor.
Woe to the children of Adnan! Have they lost all courage?
Chest of Abu Qabees should have split, burying all the cowards inside."

Abdul Muttalib would repeatedly stroke his beard with one hand
and turn the knife through and through for inspection with the other --
all to prove his resolve.
Abdullah's maternal family, and above all Abu Talib, came in between the father and the son. "This is not possible. We won't allow it to happen" they said."Let the knife roll over our necks first, then only you can touch Abdullah's body."
The situations was intense.
Abdul Muttalib was firm in his determination.
"My intentions are unalterable, come what may.
Proclamations of a man have life, and weight too!
I cannot allow it to loose that by mere insistence of friends and relatives.
Allah has blessed me with ten sons, so what if I loose one.
Further, to fulfill an oath is above all love and closeness."

Strange quandary was prevailing.
None of the parties were ready to drag their feet even by an inch.
One hand had a knife, on the other side were tens of chests prepared to shield Abdullah at any cost.

"Oh chief of Quraysh! Let me suggest something, if you accept?"
said an old Arab while loosening the rope wound around his back.
"Don't ask for agreement old fellow, just say whatever you intend to", answered Abdul Muttalib. "Aren't you aware of the foreteller living in the town of Banu Aamir?" the old man wanted confirmation.
"Not just me, the whole Mecca is aware of her. Presently, she is matchless in fortune-telling. Even people from Yemen and Najad come to get her counsel" Abdul Muttalib pierced the tip of the knife into a wall as he spoke.
"Not only that, rulers of Ghassan and Yamama send gifts to her out of reverence. Let us present this impasse to her and accept her decision as binding. She is free from all greed and fear. Her take will be indisputable". Abdul Muttalib dropped the 'daaman' of his shirt he was holding as if he was ready to accept the suggestion.

"Atleast leave this knife at home", said a relative while appearing exasperated. "Not at all, the knife will not leave my hand till I hear the foreteller. Stop coercing me for everything", Abdul Muttalib retorted as he went out of the gate.

Few people from Banu Hashim had accompanied Abdul Muttalib to the seer. She was a middle aged woman with scattered and tangled hair, face soiled in dirt and a semi-naked body. Her jewelry consisted of a tawdry neckless of camel bones and heavy iron loops in arms and ankles! The face was spooky and extremely scary! With yellow eyes, stretched out eyebrows, wrinkled forehead, blue lips and wide jaws, she resembled more of a demon than a woman. These unkempt looks had turned people into her admirers. Worshipers of Laat and Uzza believed that heavenly matters cannot be revealed by someone with a normal face, only those with atypical face and outlandish appearance are suited for such jobs.

Everybody respectfully stood around the seer. She asked them to sit on the floor using a gesture of her wand, a wooden stick polished with olive oil. Abdul Muttalib stabbed the knife into the floor and sat by its support. Some bent to about half their heights, using support from wall, while the remaining simply squatted down. The matter was finally presented. She listened with rapt attention. Her eyes remained closed, as if only her body was on ground while the mind was soaring to the heavens and the secret registers were all open before her observant eyes.

"We just wanna save the life of Abdullah, while ..." a Hashmi had not completed his sentence when Abdul Muttalib interrupted (with attention fixed to the seer) "... don't get swayed by their words, just say as it is whatever your heart, your conscience and above all your knowledge tells you." The foreteller cackled with laughter on listening. Yellowishness of her huge teeth made the ostentatious laugh even more threatening. She spoke in her unique style: "Oath can be fulfilled in other way as well! Put a number of camels in the lot along with Abdullah's name, keep increasing the number till the slip with camels written is drawn instead of the one with Abdullah's name. Sacrifice that many camels, oath will be fulfilled."

Everybody returned home pleased. Another series of draw of lots thus began. Initially, a slip with ten camels was cast into the lot along with Abdullah's. Abdullah's name would come out each time and the faces of the family members would become pale with fear. It was not until hundred camels that Abdullah's name did not come out. Abdul Muttalib slaughtered hundred camels in lieu of Abdullah.

Today, Abdullah had narrowly escaped the knife edge. His lifeline almost got renewed. However one could rejoice was not enough. Young maids started singing with joy. Children were playing with miniature spears and bows. The home had become a guest house. Stoves, pots, bowls, breads and vessels full of gravy were all around.
Quraysh were descendants of the famous leader Qassa, who had gathered his children centuries ago and said that people travel hundreds and thousands of miles to come and behold the Haram, it is our duty to look after their food and drink. The exhortation of Qassa had worked on everybody's heart. Quraysh would save all year round to organize feasts for the pilgrims, huge leather tubs had been constructed for water. Abdul Muttalib was a true inheritor of his grandfather Qassa -- same esteem, same generosity and hospitality! His means were unsupportive of his desires.

Abdullah was spared of slaughter. Oath of sacrifice was fulfilled in a different way. Many years ago, hazrat Ismail underwent "the great sacrifice" on this same land of Mecca. History repeated itself in a slightly differing manner. That race, same household, same city -- divinity had kept its secret under curtains of light. Visions of Sun and Moon were all awaiting its emergence.
