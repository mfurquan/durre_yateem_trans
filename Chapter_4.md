## The wait

Amnah was waiting. She was counting each moment while awaiting her husband's return. Sorrowful nights of a married woman are even more distressing. She would often ask people about how many days it takes to arrive at Mecca from Shaam on a swift camel and for how many days Abdul Muttalib usually stays in Shaam for trade! She would use such talks to console her heart, caress the feeling of separation and lull the pain of parting. Those returning from Shaam would tell that they had seen Abdullah passing from the surroundings of some mountain, he had rested at a particular place, was feeding his camels in some desert. But, no one would tell anything related to his return.

The way Abdullah took while leaving was in the sight of Amnah. She would joyfully imagine how he would appear like a rising sun from the veil of these palms. Red camel with bell in its neck, beautiful pannier and water reservoir, mouth of which she had herself tied. Then, Quraysh would go ahead to say welcome. Abdul Muttalib would delightfully count the coins brought by him.

Several months had passed in waiting. Abdul Muttalib himself got worried for his son. News came that a caravan from Madinah (Yathrab) has arrived in the evening. The travelers are too tired and exhausted now, will report at his house in the early morning. But, Abdul Muttalib took his sword and went out to meet them at their place. He was told "Abdullah has stayed back in the city of Yathrab, he is sick. Had fever when we left him."

Amnah was standing by the side of threshold, waiting for her father-in-law and hoping that travellers coming from Yathrab would surely have some news. Signs of worry and distress were visible on Abdul Muttalib's face. But, finding the daughter-in-law waiting eagerly, he tried to hide the discomfort of his heart. He spoke out sternly: "Abdullah has caught a little fever. The journey was quite long, enough to get fever with exhaustion. There is nothing serious to worry about, he his after all with his relatives. People of Yathrab are gentle and compassionate, they will leave no stone unturned in tending to him. I'll send Harith there tomorrow morning, he will bring Abdullah back."

News of husband's illness sank Amnah's heart. "He has become ill and is in a strange land." The words got permanently impressed upon her ear drums. It was a great shock. Her eyes were dry, but the heart wept. She started strolling in anxiety while getting buried under the weight of sorrow. Numerous thoughts crossed her mind. The eyes would gleam, whenever hope got strengthened. Faded shadows would appear on her face when her aspirations doused. In her imagination, one foot was in an ocean while the other rested on shore -- interplay of shadows and brightness of hopes!

"Madam! newly weds should not stress themselves during 'these days'. They should pass this critical period with joy and smile." These words from a maid made her blush with modesty. "But he is ill, stationed in a different land and ..." The maid spoke out before Amnah could complete: "So what, only healthy become sick. What's there to be anxious about? My elder brother knows how to cure diseases. I'll just go and ask him. If he blows towards Yathrab from here, all infirmity will go away in a flash! Laat and Hubal accept his prayers and he has blessings of Uzza too."

Abdul Muttalib went out for Dar-ul-Nadwah to resolve people's quarrels and give his counsel on important matters. Maid got busy in baking breads, other women in the family too engaged themselves in different chores. But, Amnah's heart was still in Yathrab, holding that same imagination, that same remembrance! Husband means the world in the life of a virtuous lady...
