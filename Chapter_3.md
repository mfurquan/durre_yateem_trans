## Journey towards Shaam

Around two three months have passed since the marriage. Panniers are getting secured to the backs of camels at the house of Abdul Muttalib. Mouths of pouches of sattu are being tied. Water reservoirs are getting filled. Tattered scabbards got exchanged, quiver has been equipped with sharp arrows. Journey to a strange land is imminent and everybody prefers extra preparation while going to a different country compared to traveling within your lands.

Abdullah, who has got not many days since getting married, is going to Shaam for business. Close relatives have gathered to bid him adieu. This journey will be covered through desolate jungles, dreaded deserts and difficult terrains.

"Oh son of Abdul Muttalib! The oasis which comes after six manzils from Mecca is dangerous. Caravans often get looted there. Rumour is that robbers from the tribe of Ghaffar have wreaked havoc there. Be watchful." Abdullah looked at his sword. This look was his answer, supposedly meaning that if faced with looters and plunderers, response will be given in equal measure by the sword. People of Hashmi family are matchless in bravery and courage. Dangers cannot subdue them. Their swords have protected Ka'bah during times of great threats!

Abdul Muttalib kissed the forehead of Abdullah, Abdullah's head got lowered by itself in modesty. He prayed for the successful return of his son. White beard too started trembling along with the lips! Abbas handled the nose peg, Hamzah affectionately held brother's hand while he got seated on the saddle. Amnah was quietly watching the scene like a statue. Not just husband, her whole world was going away; towards lonely forests, where no sign of habitation appears till miles of journey. She was shy of sharing her grief. Had she got her way, she would have unloaded the camel and prevented him from the travel.

Amnah's mind was consoling her, comforting her by saying: "Why do you worry so much? Your husband is going to Shaam for business, not war! He will come back safe and sound. Quraysh often visit Yemen, Shaam, Najad and Misr. Their life is spent mostly over backs of horses and camels. Five or six months is not a long duration, the days will pass in the blink of an eye." Her heart was, however, drowning in grief. Somebody was whispering in her ears "Behold Abdullah to your heart's content, who knows if the destiny will allow this sight again."

Abdullah too glanced at the walls and entrances with longing, just as somebody departing for no return would. Lasting separation was reflecting in his eyes. People witnessing this realized that even though everyday someone from Quraysh goes out for travel, nobody leaves in such fashion. Strange is this scene of farewell, strange is this vibe of separation. "Oh God of Ka'bah! Bring Abdullah back in peace. Just as we are seeing his back today, allow us to behold his face tomorrow."

"Oh Umm-e-Sa'd! This favoured son of Amir, Abdullah is going for trade with camels loaded with merchandise."

"His father's name is Abdul Muttalib, leader of Quraysh and guardian of holy Ka'bah, and you you..."

(Not allowing to complete the sentence) "You ignorant! just know playing with dolls and sing. Oh uninformed, Amir is the real name of Abdul Muttalib and his title is *Sheba*. Got it?"

"Thank you! May all the blessings of Laat and Hubal come your way."

"*... name should spread and the markets of 'Ukkaz and Zul-Jamnah echo with his praise.*"

"Saying this from heart, not just tongue."

"Okay! I wanted to say that the light which used to be on Abdullah's forehead before marriage is not visible now. Only glimmers of it remain. Just as sun leaves faint strips of light on the peaks of Abu Qabees after setting."

"My eyes are able to validate your account."

"Consider my thoughts and vision allied to yours" third one spoke.

These whispers reached Abdullah's ears as well, but faintly! heard some words, missed others. Ringing of bells in the necks of camels was getting louder. Amnah ascended the rooftop and watched the queue of Abdullah's camels till the caravan disappeared in palm groves. Hills of Mecca too added to the obscurity. She came down from the roof worried and distressed with the separation. Wiped her eyelids loaded with worry using a corner of shirt, with trembling hands. Abdullah was gone. Traces of his sight were clearly visible to her on the walls of the house. Glances, shadows, lines, some incomplete sketches from the remembrance of past!
