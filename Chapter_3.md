## Journey towards Shaam

Around two-three months have passed since the marriage. Panniers are getting fastened to the backs of camels at the house of Abdul Muttalib. Mouths of pouches of sattu are being tied. Water reservoirs are getting filled. Tattered scabbards got exchanged, quiver has been equipped with sharp arrows. Journey to a strange land is imminent and everybody prefers extra preparation while going to a different country than traveling within your lands.

Abdullah, who has got not many days since getting married, is going to Shaam for business. Close relatives have gathered to bid him adieu. This journey will be covered through desolate jungles, dreaded deserts and difficult terrains.

"Oh son of Abdul Muttalib! The oasis which comes after six manzils from Mecca is dangerous. Caravans often get looted there. Rumour is that robbers from the tribe of Ghaffar have wreaked havoc there. Be watchful." Abdullah looked at his sword. This look was his answer, supposedly meaning that if faced with looters and plunderers, response will be given in equal measure by the sword. People of Hashmi family are matchless in bravery and courage. Dangers cannot subdue them. Their swords have protected Ka'bah in the time of great threats!

Abdul Muttalib kissed the forehead of Abdullah, Abdullah's head got lowered by itself in modesty. He prayed for the successful return of his son. White beard too started trembling along with the lips! Abbas handled the nose peg, Hamzah affectionately held brother's hand while he got seated on the saddle. Amnah quietly watched all this like a statue. Not husband, her world was going away, towards lonely forests, where no sign of habitation appears till miles of journey. She was shy of sharing her grief. Had she got her way, she would have unloaded the camel and prevented the him from the travel.
