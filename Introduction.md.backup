# The Unblemished Pearl

A translation of: **Durr-e-Yateem** by *Mahirul Quadri*

## Translator's Note:
All praise belongs to Allah, the Creator and the Sustainer of worlds.
Be His special blessings and peace upon our master Muhammad.

Durr-e-Yateem (literally: the peerless Pearl) occupies a special place in the biographies of Prophet of Islam. The translator has witnessed and heard of people, including atleast one non-muslim, moving to tears after reading through the touching account presented in the book.

All thanks to Allah for motivating his servant for this translation. If Allah wills, this will bring some of the heartwarming experience originally available in Urdu to a wider audience unfamiliar with the language.

Seeker of intercession,

Characters contrived by an author form the basis of his novels and stories.
His thoughts are responsible for filling colors in them.
'Durr-e-Yateem' too has been written in the style of a novel.
But, its 'Hero' is such 'ideal man' that the sun has never risen over anybody better than him. This respected personality is the gist of universe, pride of all existence and the reason for exaltation of human race. *That is why 'Durr-e-Yateem' does not contain a single word that has not come from the truth-telling-tongue, which is realization of the verse*:

*Nor does he speak from [his own] inclination. It is not but a revelation revealed.  (Quraan 53:3-4)*

Events in this novel posses historical roots and narrative witnesses, *plausibility considerations (drayat)* too have been given due attention; we have covered this course full of bubbles and tears with much caution. Still! it is true that some of the feelings and details are described as it appear they should be, in which case thoughts of the writer have made their way into the text.

For example, accounts prove that Abdul Muttalib had vowed that if he is blessed with ten sons, he will sacrifice one of them in the way of God. When Abdul Muttalib willed the execution of his vow, Abdullah's maternal family interfered. The dialogues and the details of this event presented are imaginary. That is to say that I have expanded upon this historical account in the fashion of a novel, based on the psychological presumption of the how the event might, rather must, have unfolded and what the conversation must have been like.

The conversation between foster mothers, "Halima Saadiyah's" talk and the happenings during their journey have also been described as they should have occurred. The basis of these details is always historical, but their interpretations have been created by my own thoughts. Had I excluded the detailing of this kind, the novel would have been reduced to a book of history.

The portion describing holy revelation and onward is the most established and authenticated. Books of knowledge and Seerah are its source. I could have erred despite the precaution for I am only a human rather than an angel. Nevertheless, Allah is aware of the intention is my heart, that I have been cautious even while fashioning the book like a novel.

Many of my novels and collection of stories have been published. But, this novel (Durr-e-Yateem) is my wealth of second life and bread for afterlife. Countless times I burst into tears while writing. These tears are my earnings of life and cherished riches of joy.
