## Discussions

There are few shops at some distance from the Ka'bah, at the place where Abraha's army had crossed its last mile while coming to raid the Haram during the year of Elephants -- shops made from unbaked bricks, dried straw and grass! Few had baked bricks too in their entrances. They sell items of daily domestic use like flour, rice, sattu, salt, olive oil, sewing thread, seasonal vegetables and fruits too. Buyers come, pick their groceries and go. In between, the sellers and their acquaintances find time to discuss odd topics:

"Have you heard Obaid! Abdul Muttalib has given his grandson two names - Ahmad and Muhammad (PBUH)" said a dark-skinned shopkeeper. "... it's a completely new kind of name! I'm an expert in Quraysh's lineage. Not only I remember the name of their ancestors, rather I can even recount the times of Adnan, life of Murrah, biography of Kalaab, stories of *Loi* and achivements of Qasai on my fingertips. I know how many men from each tribe were killed when Banu Bikr and Banu Taghallub fought over rearing camels." ("That is why Banu Khazema are so proud of you" remarked one of them, hearing which the lineage expert smiles) "Not only men, I can even tell where are all the camels of descent that Umayyah used to ride on? And when and why did the ruler of Najad gifted Harb the sword that Abu Sufyan now wields. Further, I even remember the lineage of dates."
("Oh sir! you are a surveyor of limitless oceans! If not Khattab, perhaps nobody from Mecca can rival you in this art" a listener said. Old man's voice became even more forceful due to pride.) "Hutama's garden is famous in all Hijaz for its tasty dates. Their lineage goes back to the forest of tribe Tay, which got destroyed in the battle of Najjar. Shall I narrate the stories of rulers of Hera? Or that of rise and fall of Qubtis?"

"Dear uncle! we were talking about the son of Abdullah."
The old man took a deep breath, fast and continuous talk had made him somewhat tired. "I can swear that no one from Quraysh had Ahmad or Muhammad (PBUH) as name. Completely new and unique names. Heart by itself gets attracted towards them" he continued.

A middle aged Arab, who was spinning rope and carefully listening to all this while working, said on hearing this:
"My step mother had gone to see son of Abdullah! Now she swears by idols that never before she had seen such a joyous, lovely, gifted and beautiful child. Eyes don't get bored, no matter how long you look at him. The longing for seeing never goes. Abdullah's family is proud of Zubaid's beauty. He indeed is very charming. But, the soles of the apple of Amnah's eyes are brighter than Zubaid's cheeks. There is no need of lighting lamps in the house of Abdul Muttalib now, I say. Face of Muhammad (PBUH) is itself an illuminating lamp."

Elders from Quraysh too were busy talking about the same topic. There conversation:
"There is discussion about son of Abdullah in every house."
"... exactly! When Umayyah became father, he invited the whole Mecca for feast. Yet, even he did not get such fame and popularity."
"Today, I was thinking of birth of Abdullah's son while circumambulating the Ka'bah. I felt as if somebody whispered in my ears that the brightest, rather everlasting, chapter in Arab's history is about to come up." "... And my dream... better if you don't get to know about it. You all will be saddened." "No, no. You can't leave it like this. It is better to share now that you have mentioned" everybody shouted. "I saw last night that I wished to have a drink. But, somebody snatched and spilled the wine. Then, I tried to prostrate before my lord Ya'uq and somebody held me straight and said that idols will not be worshipped anymore." Sweat broke out on leaders of Quraysh. "And I tried approaching my mistress Dhahbah, but somebody threw me off the bed saying stop your shameless acts from now on." A very aged Arab, whose eyebrows too were white, said "The dream is really dreadful. I have proven my valour in famous bloody battles. But, don't know why my heart is sinking on listening to this. (While raising his hands) Uzza take care of my heart! Laat! fill me with courage! Manaat! What are we getting to hear, I fear that your flags of divinity may wind up."

(Young man getting furious, while squatting) "How cowardly you sound Abu Marjaan! Your talk amounts to insult of our idols! I fear that you may draw the ire of our gods! Shiver runs down your spine while listening to a dream, and you boast that in the battle against Bani Kinanah you had single handedly foiled the swords of twenty adversaries and that your horse trampled on dead for hours. But, today you find your strength vain. It seems you have greyed your hairs in sunlight, that's why you are giving so much importance to dreams and imagination. Just a while ago I worshipped Naamilah. Then, I met my beloved Ghazalah on the way. She offered few cups of strong wine. Her sister recited this couplet of Tarfah:

Fire in the heart is only doused through wine, however, it sometimes even acts as fuel;
this raging and dousing is all there is for enjoying life."

...(A Quraysh leader with dense beard and shabby hairs) "Now that poetry has been mentioned, let me share two couplets. I've said these today itself, on hearing of the birth of blessed child of Abdullah:

Abdullah is in the wildernesses and moon has risen over his house.
How I wish he got to know of it.

Bani Hashim were already proud and revered.
But, their eyebrows have now gone over the sky with proud.
...Such blessings are in the destiny of selected ones."

Sounds of "beautiful", "welcome", "How true! oh Ibn-e-Umm" echoed.

There is place called *Mirantahran* near the revered town of Mecca. It is famous as valley of Fatimah among the masses.
An anchorite, named 'Ais lived in the same valley.
He had abandoned the world, seeking closeness to God as per his religious traditions. He would eat simple food, wrap in inexpensive clothes and would keep himself busy in prayers and meditation. People revered him. Abdul Muttalib too visited him often.

The day sun rose over Arab, Abdul Muttalib went to meet him and share the exciting news of brith of his grandson. 'Ais was sitting outside his monastery, praying under a date palm.

"You walking briskly Abdul Muttalib, why?" asked 'Ais smilingly.
"Oh master of this monastery! I have a good news to share, an especially pleasing one! You are free of worldly relationships of having wife and child, even unaware of it. Still you will feel happy." Abdul Muttalib answered while adjusting his turban. "Go on, share it. The news has rejuvenated you in old age." said 'Ais. "A son is born at Abdullah's house. A beautiful child. An exceptionally beautiful one. Whole Mecca is echoing with discussions of his beauty. I have become tired of accepting congratulations." said Abdul Muttalib while raising the daaman of his shirt. "And what name have you given him?" asked the hermit. "Muhammad (rolling tongue over his lips, as somebody wishing to enjoy a sweet would)" answered Abdul Muttalib. "Let me congratulate you. This is same child I have prophecised often. Listen, I have recognized him due to three reasons. One, last night a new star rose, one which has never been seen before. Second, the birth took place on Monday. Third, he has been named as Muhammad! Feel proud about your destiny oh Abdul Muttalib! History will never forget Banu Hashim. How I wish you could live long enough to see his rise and shine."
